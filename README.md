# JLinter

## What is this project
This is a fun little bit of JS to do some basic linting. The primary function is for me to practice JS techniques, particularly around handling complex cli requirements and linting needs.

## How to run

To run the command, simply run
```bash
node cli.js ~/some/path -x "excluded,patterns"
```

Or use the npx command: 
```bash
npx jlinter ~/some/path -x "excluded,patterns"
```
